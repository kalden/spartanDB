\title{Adds a previously generated robustness sample to the database, either creating an experiment record for this in doing so or checking a specified experiment ID}
\usage{
add_existing_robustness_sample_to_database(dblink, parameter_set_path,
  parameters, experiment_id = NULL, experiment_description = NULL,
  experiment_date = Sys.Date())
}
\arguments{
\item{dblink}{A link to the database in which this table is being created}

\item{parameter_set_path}{Path to the parameter sets to add to the database}

\item{parameters}{Simulation parameters being analysed}

\item{experiment_id}{The ID of the experiment in the database, if not a new
experiment. If NULL an experiment ID will be created}

\item{experiment_description}{A description of this experiment, if a new
experiment is being created}

\item{experiment_date}{Date experiment created. Defaults to today's date
if not entered}
}
\description{
If an experiment ID is specified, the existance of this record is checked, as well as the existance of any current parameter sets for that experiment. In
this case, as spartan creates a robustness sample over several files, the user should provide the folder containing each of these files
}
