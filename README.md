MySQL Database Utilities for Spartan Sensitivity Analysis Package

spartanDB provides all additional requirements to link the sensitivity analysis techniques in the spartan package with a mysql database. This way, results from all sensitivity analyses experiments of a simulator are in one place, aiding transparency, reproducibility, and performance of the spartan package. This also aids mining of data analyses for the machine learning techniques that were introduced in spartan version 3. Similarly to spartan, we include detailed examples that show how parameter value sample sets are stored in the database, the results of executions under those conditions added, and analysed results produced by spartan stored alongside those experimental setups.
